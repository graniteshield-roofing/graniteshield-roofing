# Google "Online Estimates" Feature Research

## What It Is
Google added a new **"Online estimates"** filter to local home-service searches (HVAC, roofing, plumbing, windows, solar).

## Key Points
1. **Appears at the TOP of Google results** - above ads, reviews, and "top-rated" listings
2. **One-click filter** - homeowners can turn it on instantly
3. **When applied**: Google prioritizes contractors with REAL online pricing tools
4. **Contractors without online estimates are REMOVED from view**

## What Google Expects
To benefit from this filter, contractors need:
- The "Online estimates" attribute enabled in Google Business Profile
- A REAL online estimate experience (not just a contact form)

### What DOESN'T Count:
- Callback requirements
- Meeting schedulers
- Generic contact forms
- Vague generalized pricing ranges
- "Schedule an inspection to get pricing"

### What DOES Count:
- Guided questions that scope the job
- Real pricing logic
- Immediate estimate ranges
- True instant estimates

## Risk of Faking It
If homeowners click expecting an estimate and encounter a form instead:
- Short website visits
- Immediate returns to search
- Low engagement

These signals can REDUCE Google ranking - undoing years of SEO work.
