## Intro

Portland homes—from West End Victorians to Munjoy Hill steep slopes to Back Cove waterfront properties—demand specialized exterior work. Historic architecture, coastal exposure, and urban density create unique challenges. GraniteShield delivers clean installs that respect Portland's character while upgrading performance for Maine weather. Owner Justin stays involved from estimate to final walkthrough.

- **Back Cove/waterfront salt spray** and wind-driven rain exposure

## FAQs

**Do you work on historic homes in the West End?**
Yes. We specialize in West End Victorians, Federal-style homes, and other historic properties. We match architectural shingles, preserve original trim lines, and work within Portland design review requirements when applicable.

**Can you handle steep roofs on Munjoy Hill?**
Absolutely. Steep-slope roofs require specialized fall protection, staging, and installation techniques. We're equipped and experienced with Munjoy Hill's challenging roof pitches.

**Do you serve waterfront properties like Back Cove?**
Yes. Back Cove and waterfront homes face similar coastal conditions to Scarborough: salt spray, wind-driven rain, and enhanced moisture. We use marine-grade materials and extended flashing protection.

**How do you handle permits in Portland?**
We manage all permitting with Portland's Building Department and coordinate inspections. For historic district work, we ensure compliance with design review standards.

**Can you install metal roofing in Portland neighborhoods?**
Yes. Standing seam metal works beautifully on Portland homes—modern builds, barn conversions, and even some historic properties. We'll review architectural compatibility during your assessment.
