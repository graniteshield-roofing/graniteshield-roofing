## Intro

Freeport's dual identity—coastal residential community and bustling retail destination—creates unique roofing demands. Downtown commercial buildings face constant foot traffic and visual scrutiny, while coastal residential properties battle salt air and wind exposure. From L.L.Bean flagship area mixed-use structures to historic village homes, your exterior systems must perform reliably while maintaining Freeport's distinctive character. GraniteShield handles both commercial and residential projects with the same owner-led attention to quality. Justin stays involved from initial assessment through final inspection.

## FAQs

**Do you work on commercial buildings in downtown Freeport?**
Yes. We specialize in downtown retail, mixed-use, and commercial properties. We understand the need for minimal business disruption, clean job sites, and professional appearance throughout the project.

**Can you handle coastal residential properties?**
Absolutely. Freeport's coastal neighborhoods require salt-air resistant materials, enhanced wind protection, and proper moisture management. We engineer residential systems specifically for these conditions.

**What's the typical timeline for a commercial roof replacement?**
Most commercial roofs take 3–7 days depending on size and system type. We schedule around your business needs and can work off-hours when necessary to minimize disruption.

**Do you handle permits for both commercial and residential projects?**
Yes. We manage all permitting with Freeport's Building Department for both commercial and residential work. We're familiar with local codes and inspection requirements.

**Can you install metal roofing on historic village properties?**
Yes, when architecturally appropriate. Standing seam metal works beautifully on many Freeport buildings—both modern and select historic structures. We'll review compatibility during your assessment.
