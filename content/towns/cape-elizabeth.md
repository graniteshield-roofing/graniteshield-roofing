## FAQs

**What makes Cape Elizabeth roofing different from other coastal towns?**
Cape Elizabeth has direct, unobstructed Atlantic exposure—more severe than protected harbors or river locations. This demands maximum wind ratings (130+ MPH), complete ice & water shield coverage, marine-grade fasteners, and superior material selection. We engineer every install specifically for oceanfront conditions.

**Do you work on Fort Williams and Lighthouse area properties?**
Yes. These are Cape Elizabeth's most exposed locations, requiring the highest level of engineering and execution. We specialize in premium oceanfront work where failure isn't acceptable.

**What roofing system lasts longest in Cape Elizabeth?**
Standing seam metal with Kynar coatings offers 50+ year lifespans with minimal maintenance—ideal for oceanfront exposure. For architectural authenticity, CertainTeed Integrity asphalt systems perform well with proper installation. We'll recommend based on your home's design and exposure level.

**How do you prevent salt corrosion on oceanfront properties?**
We use marine-grade stainless steel fasteners, Kynar-coated metal components, complete ice & water shield coverage, and premium sealants designed for salt spray exposure. Proper material selection is critical for Cape Elizabeth longevity.

**Do you handle permits in Cape Elizabeth?**
Yes. We manage all permitting with Cape Elizabeth's Building Department, including coordination with planning when required. We're familiar with local coastal building codes and wind load requirements.
