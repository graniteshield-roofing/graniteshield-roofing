## Intro

Windham's position as a lakes region community creates unique roofing challenges—Sebago Lake proximity bringing enhanced humidity and moisture exposure, lakefront properties with seasonal freeze-thaw stress, and suburban developments requiring modern energy efficiency. From year-round lakefront homes to seasonal recreational properties to suburban neighborhoods, your roofing systems must handle both moisture management from lake proximity and heavy inland snow loads. Four-season climate extremes—from humid summers to frigid winters—demand materials and installation methods that perform across temperature and moisture ranges. GraniteShield specializes in lakefront and suburban roofing where moisture engineering and seasonal durability are critical. Owner Justin personally manages every Windham project.

## FAQs

**How does Sebago Lake proximity affect roofing?**
Lake proximity creates enhanced humidity and moisture exposure year-round—similar to coastal areas but combined with heavy inland snow. We use superior ventilation systems, moisture-resistant materials, and enhanced underlayment specifically for lakefront climate.

**Do you work on seasonal recreational properties?**
Yes. Seasonal homes require systems that perform year-round despite periodic occupancy. We engineer for freeze-thaw cycles, moisture management, and long-term durability with minimal maintenance.

**Can you handle lakefront properties with challenging access?**
Absolutely. Lakefront properties often have longer driveways and seasonal access considerations. We're equipped for these logistics with self-sufficient crews and proper planning.

**What roofing material works best on Sebago Lake?**
Standing seam metal offers superior moisture resistance, snow shedding, and 50+ year lifespan—ideal for lakefront exposure. CertainTeed Integrity asphalt systems perform well with enhanced ventilation for humidity control. We'll recommend based on your property type and exposure.

**How do you prevent moisture issues in lakefront homes?**
Proper ventilation (ridge and soffit) is critical for managing lake humidity. We also use moisture-resistant underlayment, proper flashing at all transitions, and coordinate with attic insulation to prevent condensation.
