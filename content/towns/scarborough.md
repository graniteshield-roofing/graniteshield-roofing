## Intro

Scarborough homes face some of Southern Maine's most demanding coastal conditions. From Pine Point's beachfront exposure to Higgins Beach salt spray, your roof and siding take constant punishment from wind-driven rain, freeze-thaw cycles, and corrosive salt air. GraniteShield builds systems that hold up—with owner Justin on-site to ensure every flashing detail, ventilation strategy, and material choice is right for Scarborough's climate.

## Local Conditions

Beyond the standard coastal challenges, Scarborough properties face:

- **Wind-driven rain penetration** at roof-to-wall transitions requiring enhanced flashing
- **Freeze-thaw cycles** accelerating shingle aging and flashing failure
- **Higher moisture loads** from Atlantic proximity requiring enhanced attic ventilation
- **Coastal fog** increasing mold/mildew risk on north-facing exteriors
- **Scarborough Marsh humidity** affecting properties near the marsh ecosystem
- **130 MPH wind loads** for beachfront Pine Point and Higgins Beach areas

## FAQs

**Do you serve all Scarborough neighborhoods?**
Yes. We serve Pine Point, Higgins Beach, Pleasant Hill, Black Point, and all Scarborough areas. Response time is typically 15–30 minutes from our Southern Maine base.

**What makes Scarborough roofing different from inland towns?**
Scarborough's coastal location demands higher wind ratings (130 MPH vs 90 MPH inland), salt-resistant materials, and enhanced moisture management. We use marine-grade fasteners, extended ice & water shield, and ventilation strategies designed for Atlantic humidity.

**Can you install standing seam metal roofing near the ocean?**
Absolutely. Our Amish-crafted standing seam systems use concealed fasteners and Kynar-coated steel specifically engineered for coastal salt air. Metal roofing often outlasts asphalt in Scarborough's harsh conditions.

**How do you handle permits in Scarborough?**
We handle all permitting and inspections with the Scarborough Building Department. We're familiar with local wind load requirements and coastal building codes.

**What if a nor'easter damages my roof before you can replace it?**
Call us immediately. We provide emergency tarping and leak stabilization, then work with you on insurance claims and permanent repairs.
