GraniteShield specializes in installations that respect architectural heritage while upgrading performance for Maine's demanding climate. Owner Justin personally manages every Yarmouth project to ensure proper material selection and execution.

## FAQs

**Do you serve waterfront homes along the Royal River?**
Yes. Royal River properties face coastal salt air exposure combined with river valley moisture. We use marine-grade materials, extended flashing protection, and enhanced ventilation to handle both conditions.

Absolutely. We specialize in period-correct material matching for Yarmouth's traditional commercial and residential buildings. We'll preserve architectural character while upgrading performance.

Standing seam metal with Kynar coatings offers the longest lifespan (50+ years) and best salt air resistance. CertainTeed Integrity asphalt systems also perform well with proper ventilation. We'll recommend based on your building's architecture and budget.

Yes. We manage all permitting and coordinate inspections with Yarmouth's Building Department. We're familiar with local building codes and historic preservation requirements.
