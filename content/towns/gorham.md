## Intro

Gorham's blend of suburban development, university campus properties, rural areas, and historic village creates diverse roofing demands. From modern suburban neighborhoods requiring energy-efficient systems to USM campus-area rentals needing durable, low-maintenance solutions to historic village homes demanding preservation-quality work, your roof must handle Gorham's heavy inland winter weather while meeting specific property type requirements. Gorham's position between Portland's suburbs and rural western Maine means properties face significant snow loads and temperature extremes. GraniteShield handles Gorham's full range of residential and institutional properties with expertise in both modern efficiency and historic preservation. Owner Justin personally manages every project.
