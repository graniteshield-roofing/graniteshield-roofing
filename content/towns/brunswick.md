## Intro

Brunswick's rich architectural history—from Federal Street's stately homes to the Bowdoin College campus—demands roofing and exterior work that respects historical integrity while delivering modern performance. Coastal influence from the nearby ocean, combined with Brunswick's diverse building stock (historic districts, former military housing, and new developments), requires specialized expertise. GraniteShield brings both preservation knowledge and coastal engineering to every Brunswick project. Owner Justin personally manages installations to ensure architectural authenticity and weather protection align perfectly.

## FAQs

**Do you work on historic homes in Brunswick's Federal Street district?**
Yes. We specialize in Federal Street and downtown historic district properties. We match architectural details, work within design review requirements, and preserve historical character while upgrading performance for Maine weather.

**Can you handle Bowdoin College area properties?**
Absolutely. We work on both college-owned buildings and nearby residential properties. We understand institutional quality standards and can coordinate with facilities departments when needed.

**What roofing systems work best for Brunswick's coastal influence?**
Brunswick sits in a transitional zone with coastal influence but not direct ocean exposure. We typically recommend CertainTeed Integrity asphalt systems with enhanced wind ratings, or standing seam metal for maximum longevity. Historic properties may require slate or architectural shingles matching original materials.

**Do you handle permits and design review in Brunswick?**
Yes. We manage all permitting with Brunswick's Building Department and can assist with historic district design review applications when required. We're familiar with local preservation standards.

**Can you work on former Naval Air Station properties?**
Yes. We're experienced with the diverse building types at the former base—residential, commercial, and institutional structures. Each requires specific roofing and exterior solutions.
