## Intro

Auburn's diverse building landscape—from historic mill buildings to modern multi-family developments to established residential neighborhoods—demands versatile roofing expertise. As Lewiston-Auburn's commercial and residential hub, properties range from triple-deckers requiring specialized access to industrial structures needing commercial-grade systems. Auburn's inland location brings heavy snow loads and temperature extremes that stress roofing systems differently than coastal properties. Whether you own a multi-family property, commercial building, or single-family home, your roof needs proper engineering for Maine's inland winter severity. GraniteShield handles residential, multi-family, and commercial projects with owner-led quality control. Justin personally oversees every Auburn installation.
