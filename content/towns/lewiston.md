## Intro

Lewiston's urban density and architectural heritage create roofing demands unlike anywhere else in inland Maine. From triple-decker multi-family buildings dominating residential neighborhoods to historic mill district structures requiring preservation-quality restoration to modern commercial developments, your roofing systems must handle urban challenges—tight access, occupied buildings, and diverse structural types—while surviving heavy inland snow loads. Lewiston's position as Maine's second-largest city means efficient project management and tenant coordination are as critical as technical expertise. GraniteShield specializes in urban multi-family and commercial work where logistics, quality, and tenant satisfaction all matter. Owner Justin personally manages every Lewiston project.
