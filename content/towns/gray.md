## Intro

Gray's inland position creates some of Southern Maine's most demanding four-season roofing conditions—winter temperatures dropping to -20°F, summer heat exceeding 90°F, heavy snow accumulation requiring structural engineering, and rapid temperature fluctuations stressing materials through constant expansion and contraction cycles. From rural properties with agricultural buildings to suburban residential developments to commercial structures, your roofing systems must survive extreme seasonal swings that destroy inferior installations. Gray's mix of property types demands versatile expertise spanning residential, agricultural, and commercial roofing. GraniteShield specializes in four-season durability where material selection and installation precision determine long-term survival. Owner Justin personally manages every Gray project.

## FAQs

**How do Gray's temperature extremes affect roofing?**
Gray experiences some of Southern Maine's most severe temperature swings—-20°F to 90°F+ creates constant expansion/contraction stress on materials. We select products specifically engineered for these extremes and install with proper expansion allowances preventing failure.

**Can you handle heavy snow loads in Gray?**
Yes. Gray receives significant snow accumulation requiring proper structural engineering. We calculate loads, design proper framing, and select materials for snow shedding performance—not just coastal wind ratings.

**Do you work on agricultural buildings?**
Absolutely. Agricultural buildings require specialized roofing—larger spans, ventilation for livestock/equipment, and materials surviving working farm environments. We're experienced with barn and outbuilding roofing.

**What roofing material survives Gray's climate best?**
Standing seam metal performs exceptionally across temperature extremes—minimal expansion/contraction issues and 50+ year lifespan. CertainTeed Integrity asphalt systems also work well with proper ventilation. We'll recommend based on your building type.

**How do you prevent ice dams in Gray?**
Heavy snowfall combined with temperature cycling creates ideal ice dam conditions. We install proper ridge and soffit ventilation, coordinate attic insulation, and use ice & water shield at eaves and valleys for comprehensive protection.
