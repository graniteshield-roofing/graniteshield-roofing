## Intro

Biddeford's position at the Saco River mouth creates intense roofing challenges—ocean exposure from the east, river moisture from the west, and historic downtown architecture requiring careful preservation. From beach community properties facing direct Atlantic weather to historic mill district buildings, your exterior systems battle constant salt spray, wind-driven rain, and coastal humidity. Add Biddeford's diverse housing stock—waterfront cottages, multi-family downtown buildings, and suburban developments—and you need a contractor who understands both coastal engineering and architectural variety. GraniteShield specializes in ocean exposure protection across all property types. Owner Justin personally manages every Biddeford project to ensure proper material selection and execution.

## FAQs

**How does Biddeford's ocean proximity affect roofing requirements?**
Biddeford's nearness to the Atlantic brings constant salt spray, high wind loads, and accelerated material aging. We use coastal-rated wind resistance, marine-grade fasteners, complete moisture barriers, and materials specifically engineered for ocean exposure.

**Do you work on beach community properties?**
Yes. Biddeford's beach neighborhoods face the most severe exposure conditions—we specialize in waterfront installs where standard materials fail quickly. Expect marine-grade components and enhanced wind protection.

**Can you handle historic downtown buildings?**
Absolutely. We work on Biddeford's historic mill district and downtown properties, matching architectural materials while upgrading performance for coastal climate. We're familiar with preservation requirements.

**What roofing material lasts longest in Biddeford?**
Standing seam metal with Kynar coatings offers 50+ year lifespans with minimal maintenance—ideal for ocean exposure. CertainTeed Integrity asphalt systems also perform well when installed with proper ventilation and moisture protection.
