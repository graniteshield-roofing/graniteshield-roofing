## Intro

Old Orchard Beach presents the most extreme coastal roofing conditions in Southern Maine—direct beach exposure with unobstructed Atlantic wind, relentless salt spray, seasonal freeze-thaw cycles, and tourist property demands for low-maintenance durability. From Pier area commercial buildings to beachfront seasonal homes, your roof isn't just protecting structure—it's preventing catastrophic salt corrosion, wind damage, and moisture infiltration that can destroy buildings in years rather than decades. Standard materials and installation methods fail quickly here. GraniteShield specializes in extreme coastal environments where only marine-grade materials and expert engineering survive. Owner Justin personally oversees every Old Orchard Beach project, ensuring maximum wind ratings and salt resistance.

## FAQs

**What makes Old Orchard Beach roofing different from other coastal towns?**
Old Orchard Beach has direct, unobstructed beach exposure—the most severe conditions in Southern Maine. This demands maximum wind ratings (140+ MPH), stainless steel fasteners throughout, Kynar-coated materials, and complete moisture barriers. Standard "coastal" installations fail here within years.

**Can you work on beachfront properties and Pier area buildings?**
Yes. Beachfront and Pier area properties face the absolute worst exposure—we specialize in these extreme conditions where only marine-grade materials and expert engineering survive long-term.

**What roofing system lasts longest on the beach?**
Standing seam metal with Kynar coatings and stainless steel fasteners offers 50+ year lifespans even in direct beach exposure. For budget-conscious projects, CertainTeed Integrity with maximum fastening and complete ice & water shield performs well for 20-30 years.

**Do you handle seasonal properties?**
Yes. We understand seasonal property needs—year-round weather exposure, periodic maintenance windows, and the importance of low-maintenance durability. We can coordinate installs around rental seasons and perform pre-winter inspections.

**How do you prevent salt corrosion?**
We use stainless steel fasteners throughout (not galvanized), Kynar-coated metal components, complete ice & water shield coverage, and premium sealants designed for marine exposure. Material selection is critical—standard fasteners corrode within 5-10 years here.
