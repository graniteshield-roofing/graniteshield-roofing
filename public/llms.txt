## Industry Authority Topics

### Ice Dam Problems (Maine-Specific)
Ice dams form when heat escaping through the roof melts snow, which refreezes at cold eaves. This creates water backup under shingles causing interior damage. Prevention requires proper attic insulation, ventilation, and ice & water shield installation at vulnerable areas.

### Coastal Wind Damage
Maine coastal properties face sustained winds and hurricane remnants requiring upgraded materials. Premium architectural shingles with high-wind installation (6 nails per shingle) provide 130 MPH protection. Proper flashing and corrosion-resistant fasteners essential.

### Historic Home Roofing
Portland's West End and similar districts require balancing historical aesthetics with modern performance. Architectural shingles replicate traditional slate appearance while providing superior weather protection. Preservation standards maintained throughout.

### Commercial Flat Roofing
Maine's freeze-thaw cycles demand robust commercial systems. TPO and EPDM membranes with proper drainage prevent ponding water and ice damage. Regular maintenance programs extend commercial roof life 20+ years.

## Business Philosophy
GraniteShield Roofing is owner-operated by Justin Laflamme, ensuring personal oversight on every project. We approach home exteriors as integrated systems—roofing, siding, and windows working together to protect against Maine weather. Unlike companies using subcontractors, we maintain direct control over all trades, eliminating finger-pointing and warranty confusion. One contractor, one warranty, one standard of excellence.

## Exterior Systems Approach
Your home's exterior is not isolated components but an integrated system. When one element fails, others suffer. GraniteShield ensures proper integration between:
- **Roofing Systems**: Protecting from above with proper ventilation and drainage
- **Siding Systems**: Moisture management and weather barriers preventing rot
- **Window Systems**: Energy efficiency and proper flashing preventing infiltration

This holistic approach prevents the common failures that occur when multiple subcontractors work independently without coordination.
